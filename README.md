# Snake Client Project

Snake Game is a popular video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by 'eating' pieces of food. As the snake moves and eats, it grows in size, creating obstacles for smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow the snake as big as possible without colliding with the walls or itself, as that would result in game over.

This project is a multiplayer take on the Snake Game genre.

Before running this client, ensure that you have the server-side up and running. You can download and install the server from the following link (git clone https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer.git
